# Vulnerability Scanner

## Overview

Vulnerability Scanner is a Node.js-based web application designed to scan websites for common security vulnerabilities. This tool performs a variety of security checks, including missing security headers, SSL/TLS configuration, open ports, potential SQL injection points, and cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

## Features

- **HTTP Header Analysis**: Checks for missing security headers like `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Strict-Transport-Security`, and `Content-Security-Policy`.
- **SSL/TLS Analysis**: Integrates with SSL Labs API to provide detailed analysis of SSL/TLS configuration.
- **Port Scanning**: Uses the `portscanner` library to check for open ports.
- **SQL Injection Detection**: Tests common SQL injection payloads.
- **XSS Detection**: Tests common XSS payloads.
- **User Authentication**: Supports user registration and login for accessing scan history.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (version 14 or higher)
- **MongoDB**: A MongoDB instance (local or hosted) to store user data and scan results.

   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up MongoDB**:
   - Ensure you have a MongoDB instance running.
   - Update the MongoDB connection string in `server.js` with your MongoDB URI.
